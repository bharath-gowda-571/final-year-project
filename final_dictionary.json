India's benchmark indices hit near two-month lows as all sectors, barring healthcare, witnessed heavy selling. The BSE Sensex crashed nearly 1,500 points during the week to 59,845, while the Nifty50 tanked 460 points to 17,807, the lowest closing level since October 28. The 50-share NSE benchmark index has formed a long bearish candle on the weekly timeframe with lower highs, lower lows for the second straight week, while on the daily charts, after a sharp gap-down opening, there was also a long bearish candle formation with lower lows, lower highs for the second straight day. The Nifty50 closed near its 50 percent Fib retracement (from 16,747 on September 30 and new high of 18,887 on December 1), which can be crucial level to watch out for the next week. Also the index is close to 100 DMA (daily moving average) as well as 100 EMA (exponential moving average) which is around 17,840. All these indicate that 17,800 is expected to be a crucial level in the coming week, and considering the RSI (relative strength index) near the oversold zone on the daily charts, the rebound can't be ruled out led by short-covering, experts said. \"Taking a glance at the daily and weekly time-frame charts, we see a cluster of technical evidence.

As far as levels are concerned, he feels 17,900-18,050 are to be seen as the immediate hurdles, and only a close above the upper range would confirm the resumption of an uptrend. On the flipside, an extended correction below 17,750-17,700 would drag the Nifty towards the next important support zone of 17,600-17,450, the expert said. The broader markets faced intense selling pressure last week, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining 5.8 percent and 8.3 percent. Sameet Chavan advised traders to avoid making aggressive bets for a while and wait for the Nifty to reclaim 18,050. \"It's an excellent opportunity for investors to start nibbling at quality propositions as most of the counters are significantly off their recent highs,\" he said. Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 23 closing prices: Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities Bank of Baroda: Buy | LTP: Rs 169 | Stop-Loss: Rs 159 | Target: Rs 188 | Return: 11 percent The stock made an all-time high at Rs 197.20, however, later it failed to form a higher range which pushed the stock lower. Selling was equally intense and the stock fell to Rs 170, which is its support line based on the Fibonacci retracement. It is at 38.20 percent support line. If the weakness extends then the stock will slide towards Rs 160 which will be the support level as per the 50 percent retracement ratio. As the sector is in a bullish trend, we can expect a sharp bounce back if support is found. The strategy should be to buy between Rs 171 and Rs 162, with a stop-loss at Rs 159. Resistance will be Rs 180 and Rs 188. Sun Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,001 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 10 percent The stock has completed a corrective pattern at Rs 975 and has reversed sharply on the back of fundamentally positive news flow, which will help the stock to exhibit a trending move in the near term. However, we can be buyers only if it crosses Rs 1,030 or dips towards Rs 980. In either case, the stop-loss would be Rs 1,000 or Rs 970 respectively. Above Rs 1,030, it will find resistance at Rs 1,070 and Rs 1,100. Ashok Leyland: Sell | LTP: Rs 138 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 128 | Return: 7 percent The stock was forming a descending triangle and the support was at Rs 139, which remained for more than 2 months. Based on the charts, the stock is moving towards the next supports, which are at Rs 131 and Rs 128. The stock is trending down and a breakdown of the formation should generate further bearish momentum in the near term. One can sell at Rs 137 and sell at Rs 140, with a stop-loss at Rs 143. Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 267 | Stop-Loss: Rs 250 | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 12 percent On November 21, 2022, the said counter made a high of Rs 295 and since then it started free fall to Rs 259 resulting in a 12 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, Biocon has made a bullish BAT pattern near its historical support of Rs 260 which is also one of the double bottoms formed in recent times with the daily RSI (relative strength index) bullish divergence. Last but not least volume has picked up from lower levels which is a sign of early reversal in the counter. One can buy with an upside target of Rs 300 with plausible support at Rs 250. LTIMindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,266 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,000 | Target: Rs 4,825 | Return: 13 percent LTIMindtree has observed free fall after registering the top of Rs 5,360 on November 15, 2022, resulting in a 21 percent drop in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has stabilized near Rs 4,250-4,300. On a daily scale, it has made a bullish AB=CD pattern near historical support of Rs 4,250-4,350 along with a Bullish Hammer confirming an early reversal in the counter.

Glenmark Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 429 | Stop-Loss: Rs 400 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 12 percent Glenmark Pharma has observed a steep fall of 49 percent between July 2021 and June 2022. Since then, the stock has been making higher highs and higher lows structure thus confirming its uptrend. For the last 2 months, the said counter has maintained its price above 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average) HL band (high & low) which is an indication of more strength coming in. On the indicator front, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has taken support near 50 levels and rebounded from there along with weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) approaching the zero-line denoting further upside in Glenmark. One can buy in the mentioned above range with an upside expected till Rs 480, with a stop-loss of Rs 400. Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 267 | Stop-Loss: Rs 258 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20 percent The stock formed an indecisive pattern-Doji around its prior swing low of Rs 258 and poised for a bullish reversal. This could take the stock towards Rs 310-320 zone, where its 50-week EMA (exponential moving average) and prior point of polarity are placed. The key technical indicators gave buy signal post bullish divergence. In case of any decline, its prior swing low will restrict the loss.

This could drag the stock towards its prior swing low (Rs 625) initially and its psychological level (Rs 600) subsequently. Its daily RSI reversed after testing bear market resistance zone (60-67) and witnessed a bearish cross-over. In case of pullback, its downward sloping 20-day and 50-day EMAs will cap the up-move, which are placed at Rs 696 and Rs 707, respectively. Dalmia Bharat: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,770.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,950 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 15 percent The stock faced hurdle around its prior point of polarity and gave bearish reversal confirmation. We believe the stock could move towards its intermediate horizontal trendline, which is placed at around Rs 1,500. Its weekly RSI gave sell signal after testing its bear market resistance zone (60-67). On the higher side, its prior swing high will restrict the rise, which is placed at Rs 1,947.

The BSE Sensex plunged more than 600 points to 61,067, while the Nifty50 jumped nearly 190 points to 18,199 and formed Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating bears tightened control over Dalal Street. The similar trend was also seen in broader markets as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 1.6 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. India VIX, the fear index jumped 13 percent to 15.56 level, from 13.78 level, making the trend more favourable for bears. Stocks that were in action and bucked the trend on disappointing day included Glenmark Pharma which was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, rising nearly 8 percent to Rs 440 and formed robust bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes. In fact, the bullish candle was so strong that it engulfed previous four negative candles. The stock has seen a breakout of two horizontal resistance trend lines adjoining November 15 and December 16, as well as November 11 and December 19. Biocon shares gained 3.5 percent at Rs 271 and formed long bullish candle on the daily charts with robust volumes. Also there was Morning Star kind of pattern formation, which is generally called as a bullish reversal pattern formed in an downtrend. LTIMindtree was also in focus, rising 1.4 percent to Rs 4,424 and formed decent bullish candle on the daily charts with above average volumes. The stock has seen a breakout after consolidation in previous three straight days. Also there was a breakout of two horizontal resistance trend lines adjoining December 13 and December 19, as well as December 12 and December 16, while it has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trend lines adjoining December 14 and December 20, this year. Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today: Glenmark Pharma Glenmark Pharma has observed a steep fall of 49 percent between July 2021 and June 2022. Since then the stock has been making higher highs and higher lows structure thus confirming its uptrend. For the last 2 months, the said counter has maintained its price above 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average) OHLC (open high low close) band which is an indication of more strength coming in. On the indicator front, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has taken support near 50 levels and rebounded from there along with weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) approaching the zero line denoting further upside in Glenmark. One can buy at current market price (Rs 440) with upside expected till Rs 500, with a stop-loss of Rs 410. Biocon On November 21, 2022 the said counter made a high of Rs 295 and since then it started free fall to Rs 259 resulting in a 12 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, Biocon has made a bullish BAT pattern near its historical support of Rs 260 which is also one of the double bottoms formed in recent times with the daily RSI bullish divergence. Last but not least volume has picked up from lower levels which is a sign of early reversal in the counter. One can immediately buy at current market price (Rs 271) with an upside target of Rs 300 with plausible support at Rs 256. LTIMindtree LTIMindtree has observed free fall after registering the top of Rs 5,360 on November 15, 2022 resulting in a 21 percent drop in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has stabilized near Rs 4,300 mark. On a daily scale, it has made a bullish AB=CD pattern near historical support of Rs 4,250-4,350 along with a Bullish Hammer confirming an early reversal in the counter. Even volume from lower levels is rising further complementing the bullish reversal in the counter. (refer to the chart) One can buy with an upside target of Rs 4,700 with a stop-loss of Rs 4,288.

That apart, fear of recession and selling by FIIs, too, put pressure on the market. All sectors, barring pharma and IT, closed in the red. The BSE Sensex plunged 635 points or 1 percent to 61,067, while the Nifty50 plummeted 186 points to 18,199 and formed a Bearish Engulfing candle pattern on the daily charts, indicating more weakness in the market going ahead. \"On the daily charts, the Nifty formed a Bearish Engulfing candle pattern which is a bearish reversal pattern. However, the Nifty managed to sustain above important support of 18,130 level,\" Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital said. The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is moving below the 45 level which indicates a lack of momentum of the index. The Nifty has an immediate resistance level placed at 18,300 (key resistance) followed by 18,440 (multiple touch point) and on the other side, it has a strong support level placed at 18,130 (key support) followed by 17,959 (key support). As per the overall price structure and evidence provided by indicators, the market expert feels that the Nifty will move towards 18,130 followed by 17,959 levels. If the Nifty sustains above the 18,545 level then the corrective view will be negated, he said. The broader markets saw more correction than benchmarks on weak breadth. The Nifty Midcap 100 index tanked 1.6 percent while the Smallcap 100 index slumped 2.2 percent as nearly six shares declined for every one advancing share on the NSE. The volatility also increased sharply, hence making the bulls uncomfortable. India VIX, the fear index, rose by 12.93 percent to 15.56 levels.
